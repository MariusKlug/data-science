% Assignment 1 for the class Data Science for Human Factors:
% MATLAB is a very fancy calculator

% MATLAB as a Calculator

% a) What is larger: The square of 1.5 or the third root of the square of 3? 
% Compute this here, leave the code in, and delete the wrong answer. (0.25P)

% -> The square of 1.5 / The third root of the square of 3

% b) An airplane flies with an average speed of 800km/h from Berlin to New York.
% The distance is 6381km. How long will it take to get there? 
% Give your answers in hours:min:sec. (0.5P)


% It takes the airplane h:mm:ss to fly to New York.

% c) How long does it take the airplane to fly once around the earth? 
% (Hint: google "MATLAB earth radius", "MATLAB pi")
% Use variables in your code!
% Give your answers in hours:min:sec. (0.75P)

%% 2) (2P)
% Use the colon operator to obtain the following number sequences

% a) 1 2 3 4 5 (0.2P)


% b) -4.0000   -3.5000   -3.0000   -2.5000   -2.0000 (0.2P)

% e) 100 91 82 73 64 55 46 (0.2P)


% f) "1:10" obtains the integer numbers from 1 to 10. 
% Add exactly two characters to the command to obtain only odd numbers. (0.5P)


% g) What can be changed in the command that will not lead to a different result? (0.5P)
%       Don't just recompute the input, but change the content of the
%       command (e.g. NOT 1:(1+1):10)

%% 3) (1P)
% Working with variables

% a) Create code that calculates the area of a circle for a variable radius r. (0.5P)

% e.g.
r = 5;

area = 

% b) Create code that caculates the quadratic formula (http://bfy.tw/30jL)
% for the variables a, b, and c. (0.5P)

% e.g.
a = 2;
b = -4;
c = -16;
