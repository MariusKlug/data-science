This repo contains slides, code, and assignments for my class "Data Science for Human Factors". It does not contain the solutions ;-)

The code is created in MATLAB r2019b and it is recommended to use that version or above for compatibility.

Parts of the code and assignments require unzipping the relevant data files which should be rather straightforward.
